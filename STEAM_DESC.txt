An updated and tweaked version of the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1808317085]Demilitarize[/url] mod, compatible with 3.3.*.

[h2]Features[/h2]

This mod adds an war goal called Demilitarize exclusive for pacifist empires. Your War Philosophy needs to be set to Liberation Wars to wage wars.

On surrender, the loser's War Philosophy will be set to Defensive Wars (Fanatic Militarist empires will be set to Liberation Wars due to Paradox's hard code), while receiving the following debuffs:
[list]
    [*] [b]-50% Naval Capacity[/b]
    [*] -40% Diplomatic Weight from Fleet
    [*] -20% Ship construction speed
    [*] -10% Pop Happiness (-15% if a Militarist country)
    [*] -10% Influence income (-20% if a Militarist country)
    [*] +25% Militarist ethic attraction
[/list]

The victor gets 25% Pacifist ethic attraction and 5% Pop Happiness and guarantees the loser for free in 10 years .

The Isolationist and Prosperity Factions will receive an extra approval modifier to compensate the decrease brought by waging a war.

[h2]Limitaions[/h2]
